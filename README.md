 docker + tensorflow test this repo is a test of  tensorflow/serving serving a neural network  using a docker container. I use jenkins to deploy it into heroku.
(for some reason the container doesn't run but all is fine in my local environment i'll look the reason why)

I used wine dataset as a test.
